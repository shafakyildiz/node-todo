This app made in Node.js and it is a simple todo application which works on terminal.

It uses a JSON file as a database. You may think this as a retro program which made with C in the past.

How to run the program:

`npm install` then run
`node app.js` command.

One may try the commands like below:

# Adding todos:

`node app.js add "buy milk"`

# Complete todos:

`node app.js complete 777`

# Edit todos

`node app.js edit 777 "sell milk"`

# Delete todos

`node app.js delete 777`

# Search todos

`node app.js search "milk"`

# List todos

`node app.js list`
`node app.js list complete`
`node app.js list incomplete`
